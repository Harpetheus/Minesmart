                        <h2>The future of mining</h2>
                        
                           
                        
                        <p>Mining is an ancient and global industry with origins that date back to the foundations of civilization and an 
                            impact on many major economies throughout history. Even today mining represents nearly 12 percent of the world GDP, 
                            measured by revenues and products sold. The world has always needed mining and still does.

                            But mining is now faced with many significant challenges, many of which we’ve never seen. Growing global populations 
                            and economies mean increasing demand for minerals, and that trend will only continue upward. Yet, mineral extraction and 
                            processing are becoming increasingly difficult, and the depletion of the earth’s resources and the impact on fragile 
                            environments is a growing social concern.
                            
                            Like many industries with big challenges to future growth, change is being driven in mining by technology, innovations, 
                            better processes, social demands and even new opportunities.

                        <h2>Climate-Smart Mining</h2>
                        <p>A new World Bank Group report, "Minerals for Climate Action: "The Mineral Intensity of the Clean Energy 
                            Transition," finds that the production of minerals, such as graphite, lithium and cobalt, could increase 
                            by nearly 500% by 2050, to meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies. It estimates that over 
                            3 billion tons of minerals and metals will be needed to deploy wind, solar and geothermal power, as well 
                            as energy storage, required for achieving a below 2°C future.This follows the World Bank's 2017 report, 
                            “The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future”, which concluded that to realize a lower-carbon
                             future there will be a substantial increase in demand for several key minerals and metals to manufacture cleaner 
                             energy technologies. In other words, the clean energy transition will be significantly mineral intensive.

                        <h2>Minerals and metals</h2>
                        <P>While the growing demand for minerals and metals provides economic opportunities 
                            for resource-rich developing countries and private sector entities alike, significant 
                            challenges will likely emerge if the climate-driven clean energy transition is not managed 
                            responsibly and sustainably.
                            
                            The Climate-Smart Mining Initiative will help resource-rich developing countries benefit from 
                            the increasing demand for minerals and metals, while ensuring the mining sector is managed in a 
                            way that minimizes the environmental and climate footprint.
                            
                            The initiative supports the sustainable extraction and processing of minerals and metals to secure 
                            supply for clean energy technologies by minimizing the social, environmental, and climate footprint 
                            throughout the value chain of those materials by scaling up technical assistance and investments in 
                            resource-rich developing countries.
                            
                            While the growing demand for minerals and metals provides economic opportunities for resource-rich 
                            developing countries and private sector entities alike, significant challenges will likely emerge if 
                            the climate-driven clean energy transition is not managed responsibly and sustainably.

                        <h2>Mining for tomorrow</h2>
                        <p>As we dust off our crystal ball and examine what the future 
                            holds for the mining industry, four paths may hold the key to tomorrow successes.
                            Those that are skeptical or even resist the notion of digitalization in mining often get it wrong. They assume that digitalization means 
                            doing things differently, creating upheaval and disruption. However, true digital transformation, while certainly disruptive, is mainly about 
                            doing things better — much better.
                            Digitalization is the catalyst that helps mining operations become <a href="https://www.riotinto.com/en/about/innovation/smart-mining">smarter</a> by leveraging digital tools and processes that make operations instrumented,
                             interconnected and intelligent. For example, correcting issues with mineral processing has always been more reactive than proactive. With dynamic information 
                             early on through interconnected digital systems and software, quick course corrections can be made before problems surface. Advanced digital process and control 
                             systems enable continuous monitoring and virtual simulations, among other cutting-edge capabilities.</p>
